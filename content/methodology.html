                    <p>
                        A rapid pace of real house price appreciation by itself does not necessarily imply that real
                        house prices are becoming out of step with fundamentals. Still, we recognize that real house
                        price increases today could become out of step with fundamentals supported instead by the
                        expectation of robust future price increases. If enough buyers share the same beliefs about the
                        future prospects in the housing market, their purchases will help drive current house prices up
                        and validate the expectation that strong house price gains will continue. This self-fulfilling
                        prophecy keeps the housing market misaligned from its fundamentals until enough investors
                        become leery of a bust, the flow of money into housing dries out, and eventually the feared
                        collapse occurs.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An expectations-driven real house price appreciation may lead to a misallocation of resources
                        in the economy and distorted investment patterns. Therefore, monitoring for such episodes of
                        exuberance (booms) and collapse (busts) in housing markets may help avoid a repeat of the
                        economic trauma caused by the international boom-bust housing cycle that preceded the 2008
                        Great Recession (Pavlidis et al., 2016). We take a look at International housing markets (Mack
                        and Martínez-García, 2011) with the novel Generalized Sup ADF (GSADF) test of Phillips et al.
                        (2015a,b) to detect empirical evidence of exuberance. The latest findings across all
                        international housing markets are summarized in this website.

                        The Globalization Institute of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas produces an international
                        house
                        price database, which comprises quarterly house price and personal disposable income (PDI)
                        series
                        for a number of countries. All data series begin in first quarter 1975. A detailed description
                        of
                        the sources and methodology can be found in Mack and Martínez-García (2011), which is updated
                        whenever
                        modifications to the database occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We select a house price index for each country that is most consistent with the quarterly U.S.
                        house price index for existing single-family houses produced by the Federal Housing Finance
                        Agency.
                        We extend the preferred series for each country back to first quarter 1975 either with
                        historical
                        data or with data from secondary sources. Each country’s house price index is seasonally
                        adjusted
                        over the entire sample period with an unobserved components time series model and then rebased
                        to
                        2005 = 100.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        PDI series are quoted in per capita terms using working-age population. Both the house price
                        and
                        PDI series are quoted in nominal and real terms. Real values are computed using the personal
                        consumption expenditure deflator. For each series, we produce a weighted average of all
                        countries
                        in the database, using purchasing power parity-adjusted gross domestic product shares in 2005.

                    <p>
                        Mildly explosive behavior is modeled by an autoregressive process with a root that exceeds
                        unity,
                        but remains within the vicinity of one (Phillips et al., 2015a,b). This represents a small
                        departure from martingale behavior, but is consistent with the submartingale property often
                        used in
                        the asset pricing literature to model self-fulfilling prophecies (rational bubbles). The GSADF
                        test
                        achieves this by recursively implementing a right-tailed ADF-type regression test using a
                        rolling
                        window procedure (Phillips et al., 2015a,b; Pavlidis et al., 2016).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More specifically, the GSADF test considers an ADF regression for a rolling interval beginning
                        with
                        a fraction r1 and ending with a fraction r2 of the total number of observations, with the size
                        of
                        the window being rw = r2 − r1. The parameters in the ADF regression are estimated by ordinary
                        least
                        squares (OLS) and then an ADF statistic is calculated to test the null of a unit-root
                        against
                        the right-sided alternative of mildly explosive behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        Phillips et al. (2015a,b) formulated a procedure whereby the ADF statistic is repeatedly
                        calculated
                        for a fixed share r2 of the whole sample and the window size is expanded from an initial
                        fraction
                        r0 to r2. The supremum of this sequence of statistics for each r1 ∈ [0, r2 - r0] is the sup ADF
                        (SADF) statistic. The generalized sup ADF (GSADF) statistic is then constructed from the
                        corresponding sequence of SADF statistics for each r2 ∈ [r0, 1].
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The GSADF approach uses a variable window width approach, allowing starting as well as ending
                        points to change within a predefined range [r0, 1], which enhances the flexibility of the ADF
                        framework to identify consistently, periodically-occurring periods of mildly explosive behavior
                        within a sample. The resulting GSADF statistic can then be used to test the null hypotheses of
                        unit
                        root against its right-tailed mildly explosive alternative by comparing it to its corresponding
                        critical values. Further technical details on the implementation of the GSADF procedure to
                        housing
                        data, specifically for international housing markets, can be found in Pavlidis et al. (2016).

                    <p>
                        Statistical significance based on the GSADF procedure can be assessed against critical values
                        obtained under the null hypothesis of no-explosive behavior. The Backward SADF (BSADF)
                        statistic computed over the sequence of ADF for all possible r1 and r2 (Phillips et al.
                        (2015a,b)): when above the 95% critical value – indicates evidence of mildly explosive behavior
                        at conventional statistical levels. GSADF statistic below 95% critical value, but above 90% (or
                        for some just 80%) critical value – indicates that caution seems warranted, but there is not
                        enough evidence to detect mildly explosive behavior at conventional statistical significance
                        levels. GSADF statistic below 90% (or 80%) critical value – indicates that there is not enough
                        evidence to signal an episode of mildly explosive behavior.

                                    We have created the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/exuber/index.html">exuber</a>
                                    which implements the univariate and panel recursive unit root tests of Phillips et al. (2015) 
                                    and Pavlidis et al. (2016) respectively, for dating periods of explosive dynamics (exuberance). The package also
                                    simulates a variety of periodically-collapsing bubble processes. The estimation code utilizes the matrix inversion 
                                    lemma in the recursive least squares algorithm which results in significant speed improvements.
